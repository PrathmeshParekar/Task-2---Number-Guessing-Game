This Java program offers a traditional number guessing game, where players strive to correctly identify a randomly generated number within a predefined range. The game comprises multiple rounds, granting players a limited number of attempts to guess the target number accurately. As players progress, they receive feedback indicating whether their guesses are higher or lower than the actual number, aiding them in refining their strategies.

Scoring in the game hinges on the efficiency of the player's guesses. Points are awarded based on the number of attempts remaining after successfully guessing the number within each round. The total score aggregates points earned across all completed rounds. Players have the flexibility to adjust game parameters such as the range of the random number generator and the maximum allowed attempts per round, directly within the code.

To engage with the game, users compile the provided Java file and run the resulting program. Upon completing the designated rounds, the game concludes, displaying the player's total score. Additionally, contributions to the project, including suggestions for improvements or code enhancements, are welcomed, fostering a collaborative environment for ongoing game development and refinement.
